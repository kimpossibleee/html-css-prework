        <h1>YEA YOUNG KIM</h1>
        <h2>Crazy Cat Lady 2.0</h2>
        <h3>I aim to be the predecessor of Debbie, a.k.a. the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTTwcCVajAc&ab_channel=hartmanncara">eHarmony Crazy Cat Lady</a>. All jokes aside, after graduating college with a psychology degree, I weirdly found myself working at Amazon as an operations manager for a year. Despite the fast paced environment and business travels that I absolutely enjoyed, I did not see myself working in this position long term. While contemplating what to do for the rest of my life, I became obsessed with the technology and algorithms I encountered at work. I decided to make a major career switch, and I hope to become an engineer to increase the quality of life through technology. Besides my love for cats, I recently fell into an addiction with Wild Rift, which I will have to restrain myself from throughout the 10 weeks of this bootcamp...</h3>
